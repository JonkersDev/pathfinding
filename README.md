# Pathfinding Algorithm Visualizer
In this project you can play around with different algorithms to simulate a pathfinding scenario.

My challenge was translating the algorithms to Javascript code an visualize how it works.
This application was made with: 
- HTML5
- SCSS
- Javascript


There is a tutorial to show you all the tools available to put the algorithms to the test.

I hope you have as much fun playing around ad i had making it!
